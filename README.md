# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. 

It consists of a front office written in Blazor that fetches my CV from an 
SQL Server database through EF Core.

I'm planning to develop a back office for this application for editing my CV.

I might even implement web scraping for using LinkedIn as my master, but we'll see about this.

## FAQ

* Is it over-engineered? - Oh yes. 
* Does it double as a portfolio in and of itself? - Also yes.
