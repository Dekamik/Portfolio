# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. 

It's a Blazor Server app, with a frontend written in Blazor that communicates to the .NET Core backend using SignalR.
The backend is supported by EF Core, which sits atop of a Postgres database.
This application is also dockerized.

I'm planning to develop a back office for this application for editing my CV.

## FAQ

* Is it over-engineered? - Oh yes. 
* Does it double as a portfolio in and of itself? - Also yes.
